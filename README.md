# Guidelines for generating meshes from photos

We describe typical steps to generate meshes from photos using Metashape Agisoft and openMVS. We discuss caveats and strategies to generate clean meshes that can be used for further processing and segmentation.

The document [MetashapeAgisoft_from_photos_to_meshes.pdf](MetashapeAgisoft_from_photos_to_meshes.pdf) describes the mesh generation process with Metashape Agisoft.

The python script `Metashape_process_and_filter_to_mesh.py` can be used within Agisoft Metashape to automatize some of the steps.
